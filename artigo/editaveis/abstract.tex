\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
Empurrando Juntos is a platform for participation that addresses civic issues, which seeks to involve the entire population without the effects of polarization. A natural concern of the project is the maintenance of an environment free of comments with abusive language, incitement to violence and hate speech. For this, the platform has a moderation system of manual comments. In order to reduce effort and human interference in this task, this project proposes the use of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques in an automatic comment moderation system.
